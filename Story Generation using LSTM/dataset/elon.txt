However, there is no substitute for real world experience. @SwiftOnSecurity With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition. @nicatronTg @SwiftOnSecurity Thanks.

 As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation.

 @dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard. Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port). Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping. Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee.

Will be same for 3. @_elombardo @rjpryan correct @EduardoForneck hopefully 0.21 @PeteEhmKay @gerardomarina what's the link to that? @tapwin No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity. @mpatfield no problem @CrackedUpCorson Will cover whole country hopefully this year @AndersRytter yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster @AlexBelohlavek less @torvos torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog. And, of course, it will have more cowbells. Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain. @GolfsHard yes @Zooropa88 @TeslaMotors Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year @_Only_Hawk @MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter definitely @Alandbru @TeslaMotors should be addressed this year @CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem. @iKrivetko that's not the real steering system @B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats. @gerardomarina Some tweaking underway @HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship. @MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues. @scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters. @_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping @BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally. In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome @RyanCasburn We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty. @SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch. @RGspan Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit. @jeffrey @neutyp Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production. @WaltNew cool, thanks! @mindthreat @RyanHummer Yes, if the trend continues, before 276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat Model 3 design sketches  @grebakshay We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before 3 production starts. @Model3Owners They will. We spent a lot of time on those. @vicentes Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. They deserve a lot of credit. @Aakashhh_ we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines @raytech247 yes, within a region.

If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h. Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed. @mbhnyc steel collet Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing.  @Uncle_Gus probably However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing. Definitely harder to land on a ship.

Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :) Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway. Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption).

Now we have a pet chicken. @DanaBrunetti Soon Model S will feature druidic dwarves dancing around a miniature stone henge @DanaBrunetti Well, you see, by making it go to 11, that makes it louder than loud :) Supercharger announcement pushed to next week. Something else this week. @bryanclarke physics + a broad range of engineering. Worth taking humanities courses too, particularly history. @vicorly Yes, usually several times more energy over the course of the year than is needed by the Model S @malkosh we do @itsokayyouknow Harder than that, but it is a software vs hardware change RT @Slate: RT @thehighsign: Sendup of Dan Brown disguised as praise of Dan Brown--written in the style of Dan Brown--is genius: ‚Ä¶ Btw, vast majority of credit for SolarCity should go to Lyndon &amp; Peter Rive &amp; their awesome team.

Improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. Not sales constrained. @annabananastand It can do hands free right now. Being able to text people via voice while driving would be a good feature to add... @enggirl Mostly water or coffee at home. When I'm out, will have Macallan neat or vodka with something. @danielmarshal15 It can dig up almost anything. @JasonPolstein Yeah, we don't do a good job of telling people about this feature. Requires hardware unfortunately. @grimmerkimmer @dpinsen Given the extreme burn, shorts are pushing every possible fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt story  @RaimisJ Tesla software knits together Google Voice, Slacker, Gracenote &amp; others and streams over 3G (will be LTE later) @dpinsen People tell me Cory Johnson is a shill for the shorts. Don't know if true, but he sure behaves that way. Would also recommend the Cheese Shop, Spam or Fish License by Monty Python. Hold down voice button &amp; say "Play Amish Paradise by Weird Al Yankovic". Model S can play almost any song via Internet. @realbhuwan Don't forget the mystery announcement. Part 5 of the trilogy. There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank. RT @CRcars: Consumer Reports: The Tesla Model S earns our top test score. Road test and video:  @HowardReiter Totally agree.

We wouldn't be here without you. @westcoastbill Thanks Bill! Am a fan of Larry, Sergey &amp; Google in general, but self-driving cars comments to Bloomberg were just off-the-cuff. No big announcement here Tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is Model S, Model X, then mass market third gen vehicle &amp; truck @rebel_sal exactly Creating an autopilot for cars at Tesla is an important, but not yet top priority.

Anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at Tesla, please apply! Chris Porritt from Aston Martin just joined as head of vehicle engineering at Tesla  @bdcs Yup, it is super far. Moon is basically in our back yard relative to Mars. @nirdthebird Definitely a lot of potential for geothermal, but depends on well depth. Too expensive in most places. @DetlefKroeze Yeah, that probably makes sense. @DouglasBullard @teslamotors Most people have never heard of Nikola Tesla. That will hopefully change over time. @flyguynscc @teslamotors yes, that has been the goal from the beginning @fink_justin It can definitely strain relationships, but I loved doing my first company with my brother @Vangsgutane Norway rocks! @WehbyJammin Earnings call next week, then Supercharger week after and then... the mystery announcement/demonstration :) @TeslaTrip you're welcome :) RT @TeslaMotors: North Carolina General Assembly could prevent Tesla from selling cars. Take action:  #TeslaNC @thebradholt we need a compelling video that convinces TX lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their committee. @Rocco_TheStreet Guaranteeing the world's best resale value in industry is unprecedented and backed up my other assets. Why isn't that good? @ChrisCowan_  Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system. Am getting lots of questions about the big Supercharger announcement. Aiming to do that the week after next. @stoneymonster Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners. Tesla raises Model S resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry  @yatpay Side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :) @pataneous We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway. @2552nsf Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform. @rebel_sal Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better. @Alan_Nestos The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy @darma_setia More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology. @JSONberland We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough. @BigBalli High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All 4 legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than Model S. F9R (pronounced F-niner) shows a little leg. Design is a nested, telescoping piston w A frame.  @roulezelectric This is about getting a prior announcement right. Not part 4 yet. Time to up the ante (and fix some mistakes). Tesla announcement tomorrow. @astrostephenson We're aiming for late 2015, but NASA needs to have overlapping capability to be safe. Would do the same @MelissaMontoyaO Anne's role is launch site engineering. Don't think she has anything against media -- just not her role. @realbhuwan @teslamotors Cool :) @rebel_sal Just read it. Good piece. @RealTomLangel Maybe a v long time from now. Paying div is a sign that a company cannot find good ways to spend money. @wfww Our software is requesting the right song, but Slacker has a bug in their code.

Not long now before the hold down fire  RT @TeslaMotors: Creating the World‚Äôs Best Service and Warranty Program  @tcmeggs Am for good public transit in LA, but the pace of that construction makes the 405 look fast. @tcmeggs This argument is a bit silly. A city will not grow to infinite size just because there isn't traffic. @NycomWireless @TeslaMotors Cool, thanks for buying our car! @Tapp697 Thanks, important clarification. Tesla announcements are always about making product experience better. Market follows eventually. Announcement of new @TeslaMotors strategy tomorrow. Tesla owners will like this. @wheelseditor Cool. Just read and watched! Seems to be some stormy weather over in Shortville these days @Rocketrichardp @ct_la Exactly. DMV Comm overruled good recommendation of Hearing Officer. @Trekker56 @TeslaMotors Please contact DMV Commissioner and Governor. This is not good for the people of Virginia. Not all good news.

Hearing from constituents is super important to counteract the influence of the dealer lobby. New York judge states: "... dealers cannot utilize the Franchised Dealer Act as a means to sue their competitors". Exactly! New York judge just ruled in favor Tesla, dismissing the legal attack by auto dealers to prevent direct sales! Yay for democracy! @latimes asks: Should Tesla Motors be able to sell directly to consumers?  @twittelator Yup, you're right Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for testifying yesterday in Austin. Will hang around after press conf to thank people in person. @derrickgott007 already partly here with rocket development, but will make it a lot bigger with the launch site Just had Texas BBQ for lunch in Capitol Building. About to head to House Committee hearing to advocate for Tesla in TX. In TX to make the case for allowing Tesla to sell cars. Pls come to Capitol Room E2.014 at 1:30!  Which leads me to my next subject of gun control ... just kidding No more political comments for me now that I've shot off both my feet. @TaniaPalme When a person dies, the right thing to do is remember the good more than the bad. Not a day for hate (if there is ever such). At the risk of losing more "cool points", I like Reagan too! However, I also like Obama, Clinton &amp; JFK. Good people on both sides... @ticeestes Am not trying to accumulate cool points. She was far from perfect, but her actions, on balance, were good. @richardmatthias Her later years are debatable, but her early years are not imo. Britain went from dreary to Great again. Always admired Margaret Thatcher -- she was tough, but sensible &amp; fair, much like my English Nana  @ryanjoyce88 We went through literally hundreds of variants of red trying to find something original that didn't suck. @quietlybear Do all the intro courses for mech, EE, aero and physics, then specialize in the one you like most. New Tesla red going down assembly line for the first time. We spent a lot of time on this color!  Sarah Palin calls Tesla a loser. Am deeply wounded.

Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all. @NickAPappas Sigh @christapeterso Yes @fnord3125 You‚Äôre a docile puppet of the UAW. Be honest about what you are. Amazing work by Tesla team. Built entire new general assembly line in 3 weeks w minimal resources. Love u guys so much! Pic of 1st Model 3 dual motor performance coming off the line ‚Ä¶  @Model3Owners @DMC_Ryan Might actually be his! @monongahelaEX @AntVenom Read Das Kapital when I was 14, incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good. @soniasimone lol @Gubisoul @monongahelaEX @AntVenom That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices. @kikkerin @soniasimone Very appealing if you‚Äôre a sophomore in college. It‚Äôs a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness. @NelStamp @RRescenko If I‚Äôm not a communist, why do I make red cars üöò ü§î @AbeDurrani @NelStamp @RRescenko @peterthiel I disagree with that goal &amp; gave away Tesla patents to help other companies  If you must know, I am a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks @FredoDeSmet All of them, especially Surface Detail @rknDA1337 @FredoDeSmet The mind sacrificing itself in the final ship battle @michaelshermer Direct democracy by the people. Laws must be short, as there is trickery in length. Automatic expiration of rules to prevent death by bureaucracy. Any rule can be removed by 40% of people to overcome inertia.

Needed for ~800 atmosphere, hot, oxygen-rich turbopump on Raptor rocket engine. @Shaynooooo @kausthav_ray @SpaceX  @doctorow Iain certainly wasn‚Äôt pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn‚Äôt be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that‚Äôs a special case. @AntVenom @Shaynooooo @kausthav_ray @SpaceX Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult. @Robotbeat @doctorow I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people. @TheSithSeth @doctorow I‚Äôm not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can‚Äôt compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don‚Äôt want Tesla to die too. @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn‚Äôt have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can‚Äôt even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they‚Äôre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps. @doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right. @BobbieBees @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy‚Äôs claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant. @TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious. @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading). @doctorow @dimas_______ @Robotbeat Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread. @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesn‚Äôt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what‚Äôs happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they‚Äôre getting desperate. @JohnnaSabri @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most. @TeslaCharts Then you‚Äôll be fine Well said  @slack2thefuture @doctorow You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That‚Äôs a very bigoted position. @TeslaCharts I don‚Äôt want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past. @spookyozzy @slack2thefuture @doctorow You‚Äôre just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said I‚Äôd fail &amp; be back in 3 months. @JimPuzzanghera Congratulations to LA Times and Patrick Soon-Shiong! @JohnnaSabri @slack2thefuture @doctorow Iron pyrite @JohnnaSabri @slack2thefuture @doctorow Read it.

The world is under massive attack due to climate change &amp; you couldn‚Äôt care less. @SwiftOnSecurity Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware. @haymarketbooks Engels wrote 2nd &amp; 3rd volumes based on Marx‚Äôs ‚Äúnotes‚Äù.

Jesus. This is obv a good thing &amp; extremely hard. It has taken Tesla 15 years &amp; we‚Äôre almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford &amp; Tesla has gone bankrupt. Search UAW and ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù. Very long reading list. Great organization.  @mk_rodgers They started it &amp; attacked me personally @iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America. @iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show. @taimurstriker Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn. @goombar3 We‚Äôve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties. @iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin @RickandMorty Can‚Äôt wait for the new @RickandMorty season to start! @c7five Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software I‚Äôm driving. @FredericLambert @SwiftOnSecurity They have about three weeks before their short position explodes @Keith_Wasserman @Jason @Beyonce @warriors Thanks, good advice @amendlocke You won‚Äôt find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization. @amendlocke Your union brothers  @cfarivar @amendlocke Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow &amp; nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW can‚Äôt even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer. @scottlynch78 @jenphalian You‚Äôre welcome, bad fiction writer 78  @cfarivar Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production.

Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output. @DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan That‚Äôs really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is. @EvilCorpGame Great name. A little on the nose. @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM He‚Äôs obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation. @PeacefulChaos7 @DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan Exactly @vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax.

Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target. @aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number? @gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 &amp; @Reuters. @S_Padival @lopezlinette has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible. @S_Padival @lopezlinette Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you‚Äôre  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla‚Äôs biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true? Tesla Powerwalls save the day during heat wave in¬†Vermont  Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself.  A Sinister Cellar Of The TSLA Short¬†Story?   Business Insider Resorts To FUD As Tesla Streamlines Model 3 General Assembly Lines ‚Äî¬†#Pravduh   @ICannot_Enough @SimRiyat @gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst‚Äôs track record before hearing their opinion. @benjaminpollock @CNBC Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer. @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue? @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst‚Äôs prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show. @TeslaBull What a coincidence ‚Ä¶ @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette .@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you ‚Äúsee eye to eye‚Äù with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla? @vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla‚Äôs most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is ‚Äúone of the greatest.‚Äù Her articles print Chanos‚Äôs view verbatim. This is not journalism. @steveshmidt @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews True @tombrechet @vassilyk @FlatJannrickles @vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette @Tesla Sounds fishy. How did that go down? @ajs @nichcarlson @businessinsider @lopezlinette Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette &amp; supports everything she‚Äôs done? Why won‚Äôt Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP? @Rayhawn @Tesla Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so. @S_Padival @lopezlinette .@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos &amp; Tepper with caption ‚ÄúLove both these dudes‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt sound very objective  @S_Padival @lopezlinette   @S_Padival @lopezlinette Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos‚Äôs cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective  @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was ‚Äúdancing her face off‚Äù with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?  @lopezlinette They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don‚Äôt use Facebook. @jowens510 @lopezlinette I didn‚Äôt ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don‚Äôt work for me. They just don‚Äôt like hypocrites. @MelissaLeeCNBC @thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews I know you &amp; believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said @cate_long @lopezlinette Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles. @JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole. @JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole. @ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you‚Äôre in an air tube, time doesn‚Äôt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections. @chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction) @chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power. @JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit. @JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person. @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed. @ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won‚Äôt come in @JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab. @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Great, thanks @bonnienorman @TeslaBull @trippedover Interesting @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work? @erikveen I would def recommend this @siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large. @jeremysliew It‚Äôs open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution @williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall. @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about in that tweet ‚Äî double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying. @LittleMissFlint You‚Äôre welcome. Happy birthday! üéÅüéâüéÇ @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack. @ArkadiuszKula @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Good idea Filled with more than 5,900 pounds of @NASA cargo and research materials, Dragon was captured by @Space_Station crew members and attached to the orbiting laboratory earlier this week for its month long stay.   Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does. @jevjack1 Can‚Äôt be too buoyant @VoltzCoreAudio Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It‚Äôs a beast. @VoltzCoreAudio Ground winds would Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust. Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best. @aiyanaskye Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand @thanr @ablack82 I‚Äôm in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub @maysacha 4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops. @abroadwithalec @maysacha Yes @JelteDesign @maysacha Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy. @dirkbonhomme @JelteDesign @maysacha Yes @slashdot Yes Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed.  @DowdEdward Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation. @ayshardzn Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could‚Äôve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future. @Grady_Booch @slashdot C @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot Turbo @dcliem Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit. @sivarajkumar237 @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot üñ§üñ§üñ§ Python üñ§üñ§üñ§ @DocJohnG @dcliem If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one @annerajb @sivarajkumar237 @KO_Sulli @Grady_Booch @slashdot Python is done right.

Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure. @MontanaSeptic @dcliem Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it‚Äôs on a plane to Thailand @dcliem Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They‚Äôre prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments. @dcliem   @astrography__ @dcliem Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm. @PPathole @JimmyVosika @dcliem Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player. @KyleBrubaker Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections. @DocJohnG @PewellaClarke @dcliem It is both alarming &amp; explanatory that you run a psych ward @IAmJohnMcMahon I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz ‚Ä¶  With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space @imscoops It is an honor to work with them Thanks @palicharterhigh for letting us use your pool @JaneidyEve Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation. @binarybits @JaneidyEve Tube diameter is 31cm @bweikle According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages @2morrowknight Thanks, but we‚Äôve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people. Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage  @Anna_online According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage. @JaneidyEve Yes. Those videos are from this morning. @EnochKo @Anna_online A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete @Noizey_Man @JaneidyEve That would be cool. I wonder what it‚Äôs like under all that ice. Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids‚Äô soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.  @teslamodel3fan @Tesla Ok Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team! @BBCWorld The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as ‚Äúrescue chief‚Äù) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:  @BBCWorld Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time. @Sarthk007 @BBCWorld Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point @LanceUlanoff @BBCWorld Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time. @blake_kistler @BBCWorld Ironically, the ‚Äúbillionaire‚Äù label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue &amp; denigrate the subject. I wasn‚Äôt called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science &amp; engineering as before. Just the scale has changed. @HelloCullen Already have @eehouls No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers &amp; supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families.

I meant to say over half a million people. @hankgreen @goodedesign I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow @dtemkin This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option &amp; worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it‚Äôs there for anyone who needs it in future. Something‚Äôs messed up if this is not a good thing. @RockyPruitt @kulpability @DonAndrewBailey @haydentiff @TheFerris_Wheel @100K_Ideas @GotchuW Makes a lot of sense @JohnnaSabri @dtemkin It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently. @Katheri93719178 @dtemkin Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump &amp; generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue. Solar roof is performing well through a week of July heat. Combo of using a/c and charging 2 EVs means we‚Äôre using a lot, but we‚Äôre creating even more! @Tesla #teslasolarroof  Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big  Well ‚Ä¶ it looked smaller on paper @ZainRaz4 Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline @annerajb Definitely. Can‚Äôt wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon. @KirklandJones Good point Stockholm: it‚Äôs not just a syndrome @vanschneider Why sir ‚Ä¶ üòä @jack Great move @DylanSheaMusic Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding. @jonodiener For now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com, but I‚Äôm in China so that won‚Äôt be working until tomorrow. @jonodiener Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation? @StarFire2258 You‚Äôre right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they‚Äôve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues &amp; hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good. @shplatt @StarFire2258 Good point.

You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good. @LanceUlanoff Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car.

Hope to do more to help in the future. @Erdayastronaut I hope to be less wrong over time @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don‚Äôt realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return. @dlauer @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder @annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The big funds can &amp; will, as they‚Äôre suffering a net loss.

However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative ‚Äî it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide.  @MebFaber When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they‚Äôre just ‚Äúpassive‚Äù managers.

Being cautious for max safety. @tizmagik @TeslaSupport Fair point, will reenable If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people. @JackCydia Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3. Tesla‚Äôs ‚ÄòBioweapon Defense Mode‚Äô is proving invaluable to owners affected by the ongoing CA wildfires
  @zandywithaz Because people on the ground know more about what‚Äôs actually needed than politicians do Horrible Bay Area air quality due to Paradise, CA fire...  Check out this laser particle counter "Window Up / Window Down" test using the Model X Bio-Defense filter. Thank you Tesla!  We know we‚Äôll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far ‚Ä¶  @SeanGVarney That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term. Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for ‚Äúgrant money‚Äù. They earn ü•ú vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible? @kenlacovara Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly) @karaswisher Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse. It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler.  @_sheateher @MalibuWine Is he ok? Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination &amp; delight you created for humanity will last forever. .@elonmusk‚Äôs Bioweapon Defense Mode in my @Tesla Model X works very well.

$TSLA #Tesla #Germany #Model3  Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30  Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it‚Äôs better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location. @victorpoughon Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators. @FredericLambert We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently. @madera_raul Yes @vincent13031925 Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain @TechDeals_16 We have to truck to departure rail head &amp; truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too &amp; trains don‚Äôt leave often. The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks &amp; we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent  Not much but it is ours  Um, that is not our castle.

My review: crisp acceleration and so solid... oh screw that, this thing is sex on wheels, @elonmusk! So much fun! For anyone test driving one: it‚Äôs all about the freeway on ramps and twisty roads. $TSLA Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times.  @annerajb It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive. @FrameshiftShark Radical change @FrameshiftShark Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA &amp; USAF are supportive. Model 3 previews now in select European stores   Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps  Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn‚Äôt needed  @WillFealey Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner @jsteinerman Haha, just like Super Troopers @stars4a_amy Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app. @ajaotj36 No, but perhaps in a few years @acevedo_lex @stars4a_amy @Tesla Should be possible. Please ask service &amp; lmk response. @WillFealey Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not. @LION_LIFER Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery @vincent13031925 @jsteinerman Probably mid 2019 @WillFealey Investigating @WillFealey Absolutely agree @ScaleyMurrsuit Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That‚Äôs a great van. We will inquire. @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Ok @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Lot on our plate, so it‚Äôs either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster. @tsrandall @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output. @FredericLambert @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast @scottymeuk @ScaleyMurrsuit No, it‚Äôs got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered. Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets. Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster @YoBigBrotha Yes @universal_sci No, we‚Äôre just going to accelerate BFR Renaming BFR to Starship Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage &amp; Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth‚Äôs deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons) @mwolman98 Later versions will @annerajb No, it‚Äôs the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon 9 @Model3Owners Should be next week @wiredprairie @Tesla Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days @speceye @Tesla Coming soon @FredericLambert @speceye @Tesla Good idea @Orangejamal @speceye @Tesla Good one @bevvscott Starship Tooters üöÄ Starships were meant to fly üöÄ

Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He‚Äôd originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later.  @brandonorselli Buying  took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didn‚Äôt like  even when we were only making üöò. @nichegamer Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China. Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn‚Äôt exist or would have started much later.  @danwat1234 It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car. @RenataKonkoly @SpaceX Machete!! If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps.

Buried in this incredibly misleading WSJ article is the actual statement from Thiel‚Äôs Founder‚Äôs Fund: ‚Äúwe have no concerns whatsoever.‚Äù Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX &amp; Tesla!  @TechCrunch Clayton is wrong. New tech is always expensive. Tech disruption occurs at *high end*, eg computers &amp; cell phones. It takes many design iterations &amp; vast economies of scale to achieve mass market affordability.  @oc_isly @TechCrunch Yeah, I wrote that back in 2006, almost 13 years ago! @TweetReinhard @TechCrunch Exactly. It‚Äôs a good way to go. Get people with more money to pay for the development! @Model3Owners Same applies to those who didn‚Äôt order PUP @kirstenkorosec @TechCrunch @boringcompany Boring is developing an entirely new system of transport Boring product launch will be streamed live at 8pm California time tonight  Just got 48.12.1

God I love this company.  Always a party hanging with @elonmusk!  Even when it's @boringcompany one...  This one is a little more happening than the hearing on Sepulveda Blvd at the Temple a few months back! üòÅ  Dec. 18 - Hawthorne, CA  Tesla in @boringcompany tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again  This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla @alanrrios @boringcompany Yes Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city. All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists @flaneur @boringcompany Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it‚Äôs time to upgrade to something better. The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start @CasPiancey @boringcompany This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go Presentation starting at 8:15 @joshjob42 @flaneur @boringcompany Precisely Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h). A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety. If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy The only way to describe my experience going through the new #boringtunnel was EPIC! @elonmusk's solution to solve "soul-crushing" traffic is one step closer to being a reality. @boringcompany @cheddar  @realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St. @realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk! @FredericLambert @boringcompany You‚Äôre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn‚Äôt include it. We‚Äôre working on one that makes things clear. @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they‚Äôre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument. @martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces. @MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees. @Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume. @Robotbeat @michaelknaepen @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Exactly Are tunnels safe in an earthquake?  @EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla Autopilot doesn‚Äôt need the guide wheels. They‚Äôre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future. Hopped in my @Tesla this morning and was delighted to find ‚Äúromance mode‚Äù and a drop-down list of juicy, on demand fart noises, that can be triggered with a wheel click or turn signal.

The best keeps getting better.

Thanks @elonmusk and team!  WATCH: @ElonMusk and @GayleKing test drove the tunnel he hopes will solve L.A. traffic:   @vicentes @Attack @Tesla Ok üòÄüí® @DeadstockNYC Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out Join our underground movement! Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference:  @c7five @Jaku üëç As a thank you to Tesla short sellers, we named a üí® after them haha  @wolfejosh üí® @Itsjoeco @wolfejosh üí® @wolfejosh üò¥ Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in 2 mins with a few taps. No more need to call! @nichegamer @boringcompany So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this won‚Äôt matter for the first few layers Elon Musk dreams of one day opening a high-speed tunnel system under L.A. to ease congestion. Here's a look at his company's first test tunnel.   @JohnKasich Thanks, will consider next year @Space_Station @AstroAnnimal @Astro_DavidS Must feel amazing up there in microgravity zooming around the Earth every 90 minutes!

Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized. @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; we‚Äôre using a different alloy mix.

‚õÑÔ∏è üéÑ üéÅ üéÖ üíù üòÄ Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days! Order online at  to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores. There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc  And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it‚Äôs electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements. Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!

If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:
 @JT_Richards @MMelinot @chuckyyyd This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse.

$TSLA #Tesla #China #TeslaChina #GF3  @ChrisEvans Great thread ü§£ First up: Tesla‚Äôs production numbers. After struggling to make the Model 3 for 18 months, everything changed in Q3. It took 10 years for Tesla to sell its first half-million electric cars. It‚Äôll take just 15 months to reach its first million 2/   In the second half of 2018, the Model 3 was the fifth best-selling sedan in the U.S.‚Äîoutsold only by Toyotas and Hondas‚Äîdespite an average selling price of more than $55k. No other car brought in more revenue in the U.S. 3/   In the closing weeks of 2018, Tesla‚Äôs market cap overtook Daimler‚Äôs as the third most-valuable automaker‚Äîthey‚Äôve since gone back and forth‚Äîeven though Tesla is nowhere close to the revenue, earnings or capital resources of these global competitors 4/   Once Tesla started cranking out Model 3s, its cash flows made a U-turn. Every analyst surveyed by Bloomberg now expects a Q4 profit‚Äîa reversal from last spring. 2019 free cash flow expectations flipped from -$795 million to +$837 million 5/   Finally, Tesla‚Äôs product roadmap is probably the best in the biz‚Äîif they can stick to it.

Hope you‚Äôre doing well. @Teslarati The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport. @nextspaceflight @Teslarati The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication @musicnick1985 @Teslarati Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX @cleantechnica How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot. @WevolverApp @SpaceX Dragon 2 was originally designed to land with thrusters, but it‚Äôs not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings @MKBHD @BenSullins @cleantechnica I think some of them should combine forces.

Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country. @DevClub_Space @RationalEtienne @PopMech Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels. Tesla Flashbacks, Take¬†5   Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot  @teslamodel3fan @Tesla Since it‚Äôs part of safety &amp; security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it @CabsandSurfaces Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved. @Teslarati 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp @nextspaceflight @Teslarati I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night &amp; fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair. @Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel. @Robotbeat @zackpio Actual tanks are fine "Don't be afraid of hard work. Nothing worthwhile comes easily.

Maybe 382 if we get lucky. @_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy. @SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics. @John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length.

Here's a look at what has happened and a look inside the spacecraft itself. Dragon departs @Space_Station on March 8. More on this mission:   Russia has excellent rocket engineering &amp; best engine currently flying. Reusable version of their new Angara rocket would be great.  @privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla If you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power @Erdayastronaut @privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla Very little power &amp; only right before you get to the Supercharger. You won‚Äôt notice it in range. @compdemon Ukraine did play a major role @MM2LLC Yes, but an engine shouldn‚Äôt count until it flies @CopticChad @Erdayastronaut @privater @marc_benton @Teslatunity @Model3Owners @Tesla Net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running, as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold (&amp; rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm) Extremely important merch  @PolyBork So true ü§£ Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%.  Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput. @flcnhvy We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide. @comeaujo @ValueAnalyst1 @Tesla Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time The @SpaceX #CrewDragon hatch closed at 12:39 p.m. EST!

 ‚ÄúHow does the Tesla Model 3 do in the snow? Amazingly.‚Äù @PopMech experiences Track Mode in snow
 @Tesla @PopMech Still get this question a lot, even though Norway üá≥üá¥ has highest Tesla cars per person on üåè (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice. @ColinRossUBC827 @Tesla @PopMech Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn‚Äôt critical for snowy regions. @TrevorMahlmann @Tesla @PopMech Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that‚Äôs a lot of complexity. @dave_ross @Tesla Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don‚Äôt actually vary so much.

Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout ‚Ä¶ @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We‚Äôre simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed. @THE_REAL_KEAGAN @Tesla @LikeTeslaKim @BenSullins @teslainventory Agreed @nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations. @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber. @annerajb @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don‚Äôt need it.

This is v important.  @MacBenTosh Anyone who bought FSD will get it @emilmelar Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it‚Äôs slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2. @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what‚Äôs there. Not impossible. @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year‚Äôs vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying. @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can‚Äôt. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that‚Äôs very rare. @TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag We‚Äôre going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey. @TesLatino @mcjamez @TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag @Tesla Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can‚Äôt hear, but you can feel in your chest @martinengwicht @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag @Ula No, but for sure the other way around! @marshgre @NickBre58305797 @letsrebel1 @paul_rocchini @markbspiegel @Tesla Like the movie Us.

This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions. @GaragedoorsGman @SherylCrow @Tesla Agreed @EVLatino @SherylCrow @Tesla Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower &amp; allow below current ‚Äú0%‚Äù level. Making that adjustment too. This is way more awesome than it might sound  @SherylCrow @Tesla Glad you like it! Sorry about the trouble earlier. Helpful feedback for improving the car! Starhopper completed tethered hop. All systems green.  @SherylCrow @Tesla Totally agree. Tesla phone app should have all controls that car center screen has, so your phone can serve as a complete backup. @SnazzyQ Neural net is upgraded too in this release. It‚Äôs not just a settings change. @EV_Stevee @Tesla Great name üëç @jake_cooley @SnazzyQ Yes, needs to drive best clear path. Lane lines are just one input. @christesla @Tesla Improvements coming soon @dave_chung @Tesla Ok @LeoDotWalsh0x05 Will take care of it I recently drove a @Tesla for the first time (yes, late to the party), and it is truly an amazing car. So many details are *years* ahead of everyone else. Genuinely inspiring to see how much improvement can be conjured by a small group of dedicated outsiders. @LivingTesla @Tesla It‚Äôs there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video. @LivingTesla @Tesla Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows &amp; rear window. @LivingTesla @Tesla Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we‚Äôll add a setting to disable internal camera. @slye @LivingTesla @Tesla Impressive analysis @solussd @Tesla Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months. @bluemoondance74 @solussd @Tesla I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs looking positive &amp; we will be allowed to continue servicing our cars in Texas @patrickc @Tesla Great work with Stripe btw. Much needed. @JohnnaCrider1 @patrickc @Tesla Thanks üòÄ @MarcelFeldkamp That‚Äôs exactly the idea. What‚Äôs not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software &amp; going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April 22. @MitchellHagan @MarcelFeldkamp Yes, instead of someone needing to drive their car personally, they can manage a fleet of self-driving cars @PatrickWStanley @LivingTesla @Tesla Yes @newscientist Please fix your paywall.

Look for Super Breakout and more in the latest software update which will begin rolling out later this week  üïπ ‚Äú‚Ä¶drivers in this dataset use Autopilot for 34.8% of their driven miles, and yet appear to maintain a relatively high degree of functional vigilance.‚Äù  @abledoc @fentrocity @Real_John_D @MitchellHagan @MarcelFeldkamp Exactly Static fire data looks good so far. This is first launch of Falcon Heavy Block 5, so we‚Äôre being extra cautious. Launch date might move.  Max thrust of 2550 tons will be almost 10% higher than Falcon Heavy demo mission last year Starhopper just lifted off &amp; hit tether limits!  Latest Autopilot update is epic. Rolling out to all US owners with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option. International coming soon.  @iSay3n Many different regulatory authorities.

Unfortunately, regulators around the world have different rules &amp; processes, so just takes time. @ZURCYNOT07 That would be cool. Color variation causes havoc though. @KartikGuptaa To make core AP more affordable @techreview Already fixed @kkarthi002 @Tesla Definitely @LivingTesla @Tesla Good idea Starhopper  Booster mate inside SpaceX's hangar at LC-39A ahead of Falcon Heavy‚Äôs static fire yesterday  @mercilessgains @Tesla Yeah, I‚Äôd love to do that @austinbarnard45 You‚Äôre welcome.

All Tesla Superchargers will have free WiFi over time. @TeslaMilton @IanPavelko Car looks for a slightly turning force on wheel (direction is irrelevant) to confirm that driver hands are on steering wheel before initiating lane change. Just a precautionary measure until we have a few billion miles/km of real-world lane changes with reliability &gt;&gt; human.

Can‚Äôt have it both ways. @dennishegstad @Tesla Other automakers change prices constantly &amp; substantially by varying rebates &amp; discounts according to negotiating strength of buyer. Tesla is transparent &amp; consistent. Here's my conversation with @elonmusk on the Artificial Intelligence podcast. Focus was on Tesla Autopilot &amp; last week's release of @MIT research on functional vigilance. My hope is this catalyzes further nuanced conversation about AI &amp; safety in driving.  @AlecBenjamin That would be cool to do one day @JaneidyEve @MaldeShreyas Malala @martinengwicht @MaldeShreyas Da Vinci biography Excited to see high school seniors from across Nevada interviewing for @Tesla‚Äôs Manufacturing Development Program.

@elonmusk @Tesla Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time Starting May 1 @frozencanuck Something like that @kneibert Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months @tsrandall Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won‚Äôt spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical. @brandonbernicky @tsrandall Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing. @Rebel44CZ Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later. @yaypie There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase @FredericLambert Yes @Erdayastronaut @kneibert Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn‚Äôt cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability @GregMatson Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date @CalinRoman3 @GregMatson Yes @tsrandall There is 35 GWh/yr ‚Äútheoretical capacity‚Äù, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3‚Äôs in Q1 due to cell constraints. @tsrandall Wow, a lot of people don‚Äôt know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve. @CBSNews Mr Buffett, please stop destroying Dairy Queen. In the name of all that is holy, please stop. @NCBirbhan @CBSNews Boring candy coming soon ‚Ä¶ @Teslarati poetic justice @nichegamer @NCBirbhan @CBSNews Mint berry crunch @Teslarati Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn‚Äôt have access to the video unless sent to us by owner. @KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that‚Äôs a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet.

Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost &amp; larger range pack needed. @msitver @FrankLuntz Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) &amp; we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year. @martinengwicht @msitver @FrankLuntz Anti-matter def wins on energy density ü§£ü§£ Tesla Vision uses path prediction to accurately predict how a road will extend, even when it can‚Äôt see around the corner  Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between 10 years &amp; never ‚Ä¶  Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard? Over a million combustion engine (it‚Äôs right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question. Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned? When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there‚Äôs a good reason that isn‚Äôt obvious. @jeffleach Sad if true üòî @teslaownersSV @jeffleach Thanks, support super appreciated @FredericLambert Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV‚Äôs have high fire risk when opposite is true. @FredericLambert Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez ‚Ä¶ @billseymour Seriously @Torgo82 @FredericLambert Absolutely @FancyPantless @FredericLambert @Tesla Will do @FredericLambert Yeah, there was a major change in last several months.

#tesla #NavOnAP #Autopilot  @flcnhvy @Erik2be @Teslarati Part of the factory is being upgraded, but tours will continue around the parts that aren‚Äôt @nichegamer @flcnhvy @Erik2be @Teslarati Tower with Knight is across road from SpaceX, looking at rocket Smart Summon coming soon!  @D1g1talDrag0n It‚Äôs smart *and* enhanced! New S &amp; X are much improved. Worth trying out. You‚Äôre on version 2, current S/X is version 4.  Launch in 3 mins  Starlink will connect the globe with reliable and affordable high-speed broadband services  Starlink's flat-panel design allows for a dense launch stack to take full advantage of Falcon 9‚Äôs launch capabilities  Falcon 9's first stage has landed on the Of Course I Still Love You droneship ‚Äì the third launch and landing of a booster that‚Äôs flown for a third time!  Successful deployment of 60 Starlink satellites confirmed!  @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @KerbalSpaceP Thanks! Yeah, that‚Äôs pretty close. @SpaceX All 60 Starlink satellites online, solar array deployment coming up soon @SpaceX Krypton ion thrusters activate in about 3 hours to raise orbit @SpaceX Fairing halves recovered  Racing at 127mph in a tunnel under LA  @Nepomucene @boringcompany Pretty much @EddiOS42 @Nepomucene @boringcompany This is simple and just works Falcon 9 launches 60 Starlink satellites to orbit ‚Äì targeting up to 6 Starlink launches this year and will accelerate our cadence next year to put ~720 satellites in orbit for continuous coverage of most populated areas on Earth  Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another. @kateconger Gary the üêå still crushes us! Wouldn‚Äôt be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year. @tesla_truth Ironically, same publications will attack me for compensation tied to Tesla tripling in value and imply Tesla is worthless. They can‚Äôt *both* be true! @SpaceXFan97 @kateconger So far, so good Boring Company guide to why tunnels are awesome &amp; safest place to be in an earthquake  @justpaulinelol Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. It‚Äôs optional! @DMC_Ryan That would great! @keyeslol @wofford_cameron @bourbonisgood2 LA has a subway, but most people don‚Äôt know about it @DMC_Ryan Paperwork &amp; hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part @DJSnM @Martijn_Schuman @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @fcain Exactly. Still, pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed! @flcnhvy @DMC_Ryan Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly &amp; directly that it doesn‚Äôt matter @quayran Opposite is true: you can have 100‚Äôs of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot Thus *reducing* existing road traffic @alharding @ex_Tesla @El_Timbo @heikki_anttila Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected @TeslaTn Yes, 3 to 6 months @Mike_Calhoun @PhenomenalPoto ü§£ü§£ Absolutely @steveieb21 No @SpaceX Krypton thrusters operative, satellites initiating orbit raise every 90 mins @MarcusHouseGame @SpaceX üëç üí® &amp; üåå  @M_xalher @Tesla @ValueAnalyst1 Given how many countries are limiting or setting an end date for combustion engine cars, their future resale value cars will be low. Consumers are starting to realize this. @marialauraadr It‚Äôs not my finest work ü§£ @TechVelocirap @M_xalher @Tesla @ValueAnalyst1 Exactly. A car being electric &amp; upgradable to full self-driving maximizes future resale value. @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is complete nonsense Great ad  ‚ÄúStop sending me this √©tron‚Äù - Audi  @LounDOTA @Audi Bold move @jonygitar Karma ‚¨áÔ∏è @c4mer0n @TaylorWAnderson @Pflax1 Exactly @danielcincu @Alex_Parker Precisely, sats will be in darkness when stars are visible @mcjamez @_jameshatfield_ @danielcincu @Alex_Parker ISS is extremely gigantic &amp; has lights Beautiful solar sail  @John_Gardi @Marco_Langbroek @SpaceX Yes @teslaownersSV @Tesla Whoa cool üòÄ @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum. @SPEXcast @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars. @DJSnM Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering. @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace. @meme0boi Fair You Really Can't Afford 'Not' To Own A Tesla: 200K-Mile Cost Analysis  via @insideevs.com Tesla Model S Performance (P100D) refresh sets 1/4-mile record fresh from the factory
 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency. @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won‚Äôt be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible.  @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that‚Äôs easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map.   @1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers @GoForStaging @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy. @John_Gardi @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels. @fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we‚Äôll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science. @Cosmic_Penguin Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We‚Äôll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun. @fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Would love to do exactly that First look at Tesla‚Äôs adaptive suspension for the Model S and X refresh
  @cleantechnica Yup @WentaiW @1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX True. I‚Äôm a gamer &amp; my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games. @SPEXcast @WentaiW @1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX Good idea @nichegamer Edgy move @dealer_of_happy @Tesla One day‚Äôs grace, taking into account time zone confusion. Will revert tomorrow. @Everman @AndyKiersz I paid most of my Tesla-related expenses too. Tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me. @Teslatunity @Everman @AndyKiersz Yeah, the fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Exactly. We‚Äôre on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons. @kimitalvitie @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Not bad @kimitalvitie @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Wings/flaps &amp; leg design changing again (sigh). Doesn‚Äôt affect schedule much though. @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result. @13ericralph31 @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20. I drive 65 miles a day on autopilot M-F. Please stop telling me it doesn't work and it isn't safe. My commute is forever changed and @tesla has created a life hack. The awareness is just a matter of time before everyone becomes a Teliever. @elonmusk @AnthonyFinno @RobertOHaver @Tesla Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto &amp; oil companies aren‚Äôt known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors &amp; space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there. @teslaownersSV @elonmusk @Tesla My autopilot has changed my commute. Just drove to work on torrential downpour on Autopilot. It sees better than me! @BdgBill @teslaownersSV @Tesla Based on our data, Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles, and we expect this to improve further @wintonARK Thoughtful model @ShannonZKiller @nbcsnl @Tesla ü§£ We *do not* want to alarm anyone, but Model 3 is now available to order in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Ireland and Macau at

This ends on June 30. @TMSP85 S/X HEPA filter is one of my favorite features One year ago today, I was picking up my @Tesla at the international center. There were 1,000s of other Canadians doing the same. It was and continues to be an amazing purchase choice.

@elonmusk is 100% correct, a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car.  @TMSP85 S/X HEPA filter is one of my favorite features @realkeith @TMSP85 Not enough room unless we completely delete front trunk. Model S &amp; X primary HEPA filter alone is literally 1000% bigger than normal car air filter. @realkeith @TMSP85 Not enough room unless we completely delete front trunk.

Having since completed its four-week stay, Dragon will depart tomorrow morning at about 9:00 a.m. PDT  Here it is: episode 200 of Ride the Lightning, my weekly @Tesla podcast, featuring a 1-on-1 interview with @elonmusk! We cover a lot of ground in the hour-long conversation, including the Tesla Pickup, Model Y, Roadster, Semi &amp; more! Give it a listen here:   @elonmusk Hats off to you and everyone at Tesla, these new super charger stations are incredible. 411 mi/hr is unbelievable. I love this car.  @Teslarati Only cars made in China are eligible for these subsidies. Tesla has never had access to them. Good splashdown of Dragon confirmed, completing SpaceX‚Äôs seventeenth resupply mission to and from the @Space_Station! @benedictevans @parthsheth Avg speed of NY Subway is actually 17mph. TBC loop can run at 155mph with 16 pax autopods passing every second, routing automatically between tunnels to their destination. That‚Äôs 57,600/hour/lane &amp; you can build dozens of lanes. Will crush any subway in throughput &amp; convenience. @FredericLambert @benedictevans @parthsheth Yes, as you point out, it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings @UzakbayDaniyar Tesla Superchargers &amp; service centers coming to Kazakhstan this year @benedictevans @parthsheth 155mph is common on the Autobahn. Even with only 5 offramp tunnels, exit speed drops to 31mph. @WillFealey No problem if you want to post the suggestions on this timeline. It‚Äôs great to get thoughtful criticism. @Izackton12 Yes @BloodsportCap @Teslarati China EV subsidies mostly end this month &amp; fully end in about 7 months Tesla Navigate on Autopilot seamlessly handles construction zone with no lane lines
